## Description

This web application is a mock up of a blog posting website that can be made to view posts and make comments with other users after going through an authentication and sign up process.

## Installation

The node packages used in this application to allow it to function properly and therefore must be installed before attempting to use this code on your own are: bcrypt, connect-session-sequelize, dotenv, express, express-handlebars, express-session, mysql2, and sequelize. All packages which can be installed through the terminal. 

## Usage

This application can be used as a simple blogpost website, this one however has a magicians guild theme, so you MUST be a magician to use it.....or anyone else.

## Contributing

I, Michael Davidson am the only one that contributed to this code using handlebars, JavaScript, Node, and the Node packages listed above. I implemented all my resources to create this code and tapped into the resources of the UTA bootcamp I'm attending at the time of making this application as well.
